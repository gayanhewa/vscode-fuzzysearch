# Fuzzy File Search Extension for Visual Studio Code

Since VSCodes `CMD + P` tends to be quite slow sometimes. This extension can be used as a replacement where we use the operating system built in `find` command to search for files within the workspace.

## Features

- Ability to fuzzy search trough the project files

## Requirements

- As of now only requirement is shelljs `.find()` method works on your enviorment. Since this extension has only been tested on Linux and OSX support for Windows it yet to be added once significant test data is present. PR's are welcom.

## Known Issues

Might not work on Windows Operating systems.

## Release Notes

This is a pre-release of the extension and the extension is still under development. Please expect failures.

**Enjoy!**
