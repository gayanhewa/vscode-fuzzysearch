# Change Log
Fuzzy File Search Visual Studio Code Extension ChangeLog

## [v0.0.1a]
- Integrated with ShellJS to look for workspace files for quicker search experience and better fuzzy search
- Experience is more similar to how Sublime Text of fzf extension works on zsh or bash
- Only tested on Linux / OSX enviorments, ideally might be unstable within windows enviorments.
- By default the extension ignores .git and .vscode directories. But doesn't ignore vendor directories. This is intentional for now. Will be introducing excluded directories via settings in the future.
